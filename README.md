# Long description

We have come up with an ideaof“ NIL WASTAGE OF FOOD”. 
We created an application that shares data of left-over food from different sources with minimal cost. We gather information from different sources and connect them with common people. It overcomes the disadvantage of wastage of food. Using this application, we can connect the people who are in need of food with the source person easily. Here we have two logins as supplier and customer . Where suppliers are the source person.
First, they need to register into the application and then login with their details. After login, if it’s a supplier he needs to  share the information  about the food, organization name, location, cost, contact number in the product page. Now if the customer has already registered in our application he will be notified with the details left by the supplier. And so, he can direct it with them. Instantly the supplier will also be notified with the order details. 
Nearly 40 percent of the food produced is wasted every year due to fragmented food system and insufficient supply chain. It was when the Covid-19 pandemic came along in 2020 that many of us beganworrying about how long their supplies would last.The pandemic not only exposed the problems on food waste but also compounded them. In the wake of the lockdown imposed last year, surplus stocks of grain pegged at 65 lakh tonnes in the first four months of 2020  continued to rot in godowns across India. Access to food became extremely scarce for the poor, especially daily-wage labourers. Although essential commodities were exempt from movement restrictions, farmers across the country struggled to access markets, resulting in tonnes of food waste.

So, When excess foodstuffs are still safe to eat, they can be given to the hungry and the poor who find it difficult to afford sufficient food in today’s high-priced economy. Also, it helps from Food waste that ends up in landfills produces a large amount of methane  a more powerful greenhouse gas than even CO2. Excess amounts of greenhouse gases such as methane, CO2 and chloroflurocarbons absorb infrared radiation and heat up the earth’s atmosphere, causing global warming and climate change.
